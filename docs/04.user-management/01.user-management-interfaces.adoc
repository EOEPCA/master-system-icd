== Interfaces 

[NOTE]
.Work In Progress
===============================================
This section focuses on the externally available functionality published over interfaces, and how these interfaces connect with external systems.
Each building block contains:

* Description of functionality

* List of exposed interfaces by URL
* List of services

Each service contains:

* Description of functionality
* Component diagram
* List of exposed interfaces by URL

Each interface in the list contains:

* Unique URL (\*)
* Interface name
* Used port/communications protocol
* Endpoint URL
* Applicable standards
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions

(\*) URL would be formed as [port]://[building-block].[eoepca.org]/[endpoint], e.g. https://iam.eoepca.org/logout

=== Identity and Authentication management
* Description of functionality

The solution for IAM is driven by the need for Federated Identity and Authorization in the context of a network of collaborating exploitation platforms and connected services. This federated environment should facilitate an end-user experience in which they can use a single identity across collaborating platforms (Single Sign-On), they can bring their own existing identity to the platforms ('Login With' service), and platforms can access the federated services of other platforms on behalf of the end-user (delegated access and authorization).

The goal of IAM is to uniquely identify the user and limit access to protected resources to those having suitable access rights. We assume an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) approach in which authorization decisions are made based upon access policies/rules that define attributes required by resources and possessed (as claims) by users. ABAC is is seen as a more flexible approach than Role Base Access Control (RBAC), affording the ability to express more sophisticated authorizations rules beyond the role(s) of the user - and noting the fact that a role-based ruleset could be implemented within an attribute based approach, (i.e. RBAC is a subset/specialisation of ABAC).

==== IAM interfaces

The primary endpoints required to support the OIDC flows are as follows (these endpoints are taken, by example, from OKTA OIDC discovery metadata, https://micah.okta.com/oauth2/aus2yrcz7aMrmDAKZ1t7/.well-known/openid-configuration):

[[authorization]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/authorize

* Description - To initiate the authentication, and to return the access tokens / code grant (depending on flow).
* Applicable standards - 
* Operations - 
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

[[token]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/token

* Description - To exchange the code grant for the access tokens.
* Applicable standards
* Operations -
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

[[userinfo]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/userinfo

* Description - To obtain the user information ID token in accordance with the scopes requested in the authorization request.
* Applicable standards
* Operations -
* Conveyed information - Returns an <<oidc_id_token>> that asserts a user’s authenticated identity with integrity, and non-repudiation.
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

[[jwks]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/keys

* Description - To obtain signing keys for Token validation purposes.
* Applicable standards
* Operations -
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

[[end]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/logout

* Description - To logout the user from the Login Service, i.e. clear session cookies etc. Although, given that the actual IdP is externalised from the Login Service, it would remain the case that any session cookies maintained by the external IdP would still be in place for a future authentication flow.
* Applicable standards
* Operations -
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

[[introspection]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/introspect

* Description - Used by clients to verify access tokens. 
* Applicable standards
* Operations -
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

[[revocation]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/revoke

* Description - Used for (refresh) token revocation.
* Applicable standards
* Operations -
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

The following endpoints relate to Discovery:

[[discovery]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/.well-known/openid-configuration

* Description - Dynamic discovery of OIDC endpoints by clients.

OpenID Connect makes provision for two types of discovery:

** Discovery of the OpenID Provider Issuer based upon the user’s identifier

** Discovery of the OpenID Provider Configuration Information

In the case of our usage within the Exploitation Platform, type 1) is not application since the user’s ID comes from their ‘Home’ organisation and is not (necessarily) tied to an OpenID Connect Provider. Instead the Login Service must implement a discovery ‘flow’ in which the user is able to select the provider of their identity, as one that is supported by the Login Service deployment.

Regarding discovery type 2), the Login Service exposes an OIDC Provider interface, and this should support retrieval of OIDC Provider Configuration Information. Thus, OIDC Clients can utilise the discovery interface of the Login Service to exploit its services.

This is of most interest in the case of access to federated resources in other EPs, where a resource server in one EP may be acting as an OIDC client of the Login Service in another EP – in which case auto-discovery might be more attractive.

The following endpoints relate to Dynamic Client Registration:

[[registration]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/clients

* Description - Dynamic registration of clients (Authentication Agents).

The possibility exists for the OIDC Client (Login Service) to perform auto-registration with the Login Service, using OIDC Client Registration. In doing so the OIDC client obtains its Client ID and Secret.

This may be of interest in a couple of cases:

** The case of access to federated resources in other EPs, where a resource server in one EP may be acting as an OIDC client of the Login Service in another EP – in which case auto-client-registration might be of interest.

** The case where a common Login Service is deployed outside of the context of a given Exploitation Platform, acting as an IdP Proxy. In this case, the local Login Service deployed in each EP would register as an OIDC Client of the IdP Proxy.

The following endpoints relate to the establishment of a federation of collaborating Exploitation Platforms through a dynamic trust model:

[[federation]] URI: https://iam.eoepca.org/.well-known/openid-configuration

* Description - OIDC Federation API endpoint through which Entity Statements are published about itself and other entities (such as other Exploitation Platforms).
* Applicable standards
* Operations -
* Conveyed information
* Control and data flow descriptions
* Usage examples

==== IAM information

[[oidc_id_token]] OICD ID token

The ID Token is a JWT that is returned to from the /userinfo endpoint of the Login Service. The returned OIDC ID Token has been signed (JWS) by the Login Service and thus results in a token that asserts a user’s authenticated identity with integrity, and non-repudiation.
